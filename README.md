### Conquer is a productivity app which allows users to divide their tasks and goals into five segments: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and long term. Users can create, update, prioritize and delete tasks in all these sections. This is available both as a [web](https://conquer-goals.netlify.app/) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conquer_app) app





### This repo handles the android app of conquer which has a few extra features: allows you to postpone, and add reminders for these tasks.

### I am currently trying to add reminders support; users will be able to add reminders for certain tasks and they will get notified when that reminder triggers(trust me its easier said than built)
******
## Tech Stack used: 
### I have primarily used React Native and Firebase for this app. But a few features(reminders for instance)  are built using java and I have used [Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) to bridge React Native and Java.

*******
## Upcoming features for the android app:
1. ### Nudger: a way to blacklist some of your apps and getting a notification of the remaining tasks every 15 minutes you use the blacklisted apps. I came up with this idea as a better alternative to app blockers: App blockers block the app completely but there are apps like Youtube which are used for both entertainment and educational purposes. So instead having something which induces guilt in you every 15 minutes you use such an app makes more sense...
2. ### Widget support
3. ### Google calendar integration for daily tasks
