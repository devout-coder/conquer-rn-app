Conquer is a productivity app which allows users to divide their tasks and goals into five segments: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and long term. Users can create, update, prioritize and delete tasks in all these sections. This is available both as a [web](https://conquer-goals.netlify.app/)(PWA) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conquer_app) app

This repo handles the android app of conquer which has a few extra features: allows users to postpone tasks and add reminders for these tasks.
[This](https://github.com/devout-coder/conquer) is the repo containing the code of the web app

## Tech Stack used:

I have primarily used React Native and Firebase for this app. But a few features(reminders for instance) are built using java and I have used [Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) to bridge React Native and Java.
